**Gradient-based and gradient-free optimization**

A modular, high-performance optimization library developed by Christian Lozoya in JavaScript. It provides a unified API for both gradient-based and gradient-free methods, enabling optimization directly in the browser.

# Algorithm Suite
- Gradient-based:
  - Gradient Descent (Adam, AMSGrad, Nadam)
- Gradient-free:
  - CMA-ES
  - Particle Swarm
  - Ant Colony
  - Genetic Algorithm
  - Simulated Annealing
- Constraint handling: Hard and soft constraint enforcement via penalty, barrier, and augmented Lagrangian formulations.
